# Python-Repository
This is a repository for Python programming. Very essential information on easily forgettable Python syntax concepts are featured here. 
This is not a functional program and should not be run with an IDE. Rather, it chould be opened with a text editor like 'Notepad++' or the likes.
The repository would be updated from time to time. Concepts that may be missing can be pointed out for inclusion.

Note: This is not a learning guide for absolute beginners of Python programming. It is just more like a reference of important concpets for those who are a bit more advanced with the Python programming language.
